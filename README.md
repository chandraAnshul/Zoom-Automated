# Zoom-Automated
Bored of attending online lectures?? Run this program and it will join and leave the meeting on the given time!!!
All you need to do is enter the user name, password, start time and end time in the list(lst) already declared in the program.
In the zoom settings(general), make sure you uncheck the "Ask me to confirm when I leave" option AND the keyboard shortcut for leaving a meeting should be "alt+q".
